* demo of using asp.net core signalR(npm package @microsoft/signalr):
Noteï¼š signalr hub invocation and data listener registration are done not via string literal, but use a config file for each hub, and javascript dynamically add methods to signalr hub service object, thus enjoy the intellisense feature and avoid typo errors.
